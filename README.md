## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### User Roles

1. **Admin**: Full system access, can manage all users, teams, and tasks
2. **Leader**: Team management capabilities, can create and assign tasks within their teams
3. **Member**: Basic user access, can view and update assigned tasks

### Permission System

The application uses a granular permission system based on:
- **Resource**: What the user wants to access (task, team, user, etc.)
- **Action**: What they want to do (create, read, update, delete)
- **Scope**: The extent of access (own, team, all)

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Entities

- **Users**: System users with roles and authentication data
- **Teams**: Groups of users working together
- **TeamMembers**: Junction table for user-team relationships
- **Tasks**: Work items with status, priority, and assignments
- **Events**: Calendar events with team and task associations
- **Comments**: Task discussions and updates
- **Activities**: System activity tracking
